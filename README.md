-- Data Cleaning 
-- Orders Table 

  while importing data into SQL, due to the presence of blanks, all timestamp type columns are by default considered as text type. 
    -- to convert them back to timestamp
    -- first replace missing with nulls
    -- change text to timestamp 
 or 
  -- SQL accepts yyyy-mm-dd format only 
  -- so change dd-mm-yyyy
